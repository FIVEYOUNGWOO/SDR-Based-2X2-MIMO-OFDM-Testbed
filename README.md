# SDR-Based 2X2 MIMO OFDM Testbed

A 2X2 MIMO OFDM transmitter and receiver, based on software-defined radio (SDR), were implemented using LabVIEW 2020 and the NI-USRP2932.

To acquire consecutive channel state information (CSI) data, the testbed code incorporates simple least squares (LS) channel estimation and OFDM preamble methods.

The real-time testbed demonstration was uploaded to the YouTube channel:
